This mod allows for intermediate products and fluids to be compressed, which greatly increase the throughput for belts and trains. **LOGISTIC ROBOTS DROP COMPRESSED ITEMS** because they are too heavy to carry. So unless you enjoy picking up items on the ground, it is suggested to not request compressed items.
